# Python-Data-Scraping

### Objective:
Complete a web-scraping and data analysis project to strengthen data skills, including identification of HTML elements, automated browsing with Splinter, and parsing with Beautiful Soup. Create two deliverables: scrape Mars news article titles and preview text, and analyze Mars weather data. Demonstrate proficiency in collecting, organizing, analyzing, and visually presenting insights from web data.

### Summary:
This project involves two main tasks. The first task is to scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles using Beautiful Soup and Splinter for automated browsing. The second task involves scraping and analyzing Mars weather data, assembling it into a Pandas DataFrame, and answering questions related to temperature, atmospheric pressure, and time on Mars. Both tasks aim to enhance data skills by applying web-scraping techniques and performing data analysis.
